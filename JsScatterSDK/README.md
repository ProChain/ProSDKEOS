this middle sovle the problem of the web dapp [EOS] 's sign transaction problem while running on mobile browser.


====================================================

(3)how to use

[3.1] For iOS

1. Copy pra_middleware.js file into your project,

2. implementation a scatterWebview controller similar with the on in iOS/PCScatterViewContrller
you need to using your local native EOS wallet to replace the folowing function


-(void)scatter_getIdentity:(NSString*)callbackUrl

-(void)scatter_ForgetIdentity:(NSString*)callbackUrl

-(void)scatter_authenticate:(NSString*)key withCallback:(NSString*)callbackUrl

-(void)scatter_getArbitrarySignature:(NSString*)signData;

-(void)scatter_transaction:(NSString*)callbackUrl withParams:(NSDictionary*)params

3. using your customize webview to load any url support scatter protocol ,
after the remote url is finish loaded, load the pra_middleware.js in the webview, to hook the scatter obj,
then you can using your native wallet to 
play with EOS chain.






=====================================================

[3.2] For Android


1. Copy pra_middleware.js file into your project,
2. implemetation web interface contains the following logic

scatterWebInterface:

 @JavascriptInterface
    public String getIdentity( String contract,
                               String action,
                               String param,
                               String callbackStr);
                               
                               
                               
                               
                               
@JavascriptInterface
    public void forgetIdentity(String contract,
                               String action,
                               String param,
                               String callbackStr)
                               



@JavascriptInterface
    public String authenticate(String contract,
                               String action,
                               String param,
                               String callbackStr)





@JavascriptInterface
    public String getArbitrarySignature(String contract,
                                        String action,
                                        String param,
                                        String callbackStr)
                                        



@JavascriptInterface
    public void transaction(String contract,
                         String action,
                         String param,
                         String callbackStr)
                         
                         
scatterWebview:

implemetation the js inject, init the webview , 


3.  using your customize webview to load any url support scatter protocol ,
after the remote url is finish loaded, load the pra_middleware.js in the webview, to hook the scatter obj,
then you can using your native wallet to 
play with EOS chain.
